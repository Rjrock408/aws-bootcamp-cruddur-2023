HOW to create a new branch in the git repo::
https://graphite.dev/guides/git-commit-to-new-branch
    Create a new branch with git checkout -b new-feature
    Add changes to your new branch with git add
    Commit your changes with git commit -m "Your message"
    Push your branch to a remote with git push -u origin new-feature

Step 1: Create a new branch:
```git checkout -b new-feature```
Create a new branch and keep your staged changes
```git checkout -b new-feature```
If you have changes already staged (using git add), and you want to move these to a new branch

Step 2: Add changes to the new branch::

```git add <file-or-directory>```

Step 3: Commit the changes::

```git commit -m "Add a descriptive message here"```

Step 4: Push the new branch to a remote repository
Check if the remote exists

Before pushing, check if the remote repository is set up:
```git remote -v```

```git remote add origin <repository-url>```

Push the new branch to the remote repository

```git push -u origin new-feature```
