HOW to create a new branch in the git repo::
https://graphite.dev/guides/git-commit-to-new-branch
    Create a new branch with git checkout -b new-feature
    Add changes to your new branch with git add
    Commit your changes with git commit -m "Your message"
    Push your branch to a remote with git push -u origin new-feature

Step 1: Create a new branch:
```git checkout -b new-feature```
Create a new branch and keep your staged changes
```git checkout -b new-feature```
If you have changes already staged (using git add), and you want to move these to a new branch

Step 2: Add changes to the new branch::

```git add <file-or-directory>```

Step 3: Commit the changes::

```git commit -m "Add a descriptive message here"```

Step 4: Push the new branch to a remote repository
Check if the remote exists

Before pushing, check if the remote repository is set up:
```git remote -v```

```git remote add origin <repository-url>```

Push the new branch to the remote repository

```git push -u origin new-feature```

Create an AWS Budget

aws budgets create-budget

Get your AWS Account ID

aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text

    Supply your AWS Account ID
    Update the json files
    This is another case with AWS CLI its just much easier to json files due to lots of nested json

aws budgets create-budget \
    --account-id AccountID \
    --budget file://aws/json/budget.json \
    --notifications-with-subscribers file://aws/json/budget-notifications-with-subscribers.json


Enable Billing

We need to turn on Billing Alerts to recieve alerts...

    In your Root Account go to the Billing Page
    Under Billing Preferences Choose Receive Billing Alerts
    Save Preferences

Creating a Billing Alarm
Create SNS Topic

    We need an SNS topic before we create an alarm.
    The SNS topic is what will delivery us an alert when we get overbilled
    aws sns create-topic

We'll create a SNS Topic

aws sns create-topic --name billing-alarm

which will return a TopicARN

We'll create a subscription supply the TopicARN and our Email

aws sns subscribe \
    --topic-arn TopicARN \
    --protocol email \
    --notification-endpoint your@email.com

Check your email and confirm the subscription

Create Alarm

    aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm
    Create an Alarm via AWS CLI
    We need to update the configuration json script with the TopicARN we generated earlier
    We are just a json file because --metrics is is required for expressions and so its easier to us a JSON file.

aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --cli-input-json file://aws/json/alarm_config.json
